# NetflixViewingData
Run broad trends on your personalized Netflix Viewing Data

This is a fun intro project for starting in **Python** to run trends on my Netflix Viewing Data. You can determine trends such as total amount of media consumed, most viewed show, most clicked show, average time spent on Netflix on every day of the week, average view time by the hour. Also as a fun bonus, I included trends on 'The Office' specifically.

To get started, gather you netflix viewing history. It might take a few days to actually receive the file but I got it within 24 hours.This can be found here:

Next proceed through the steps - the only input required is your Netflix Profile name. 

Note: I was inspired to this from the blog found here:

Enjoy!
